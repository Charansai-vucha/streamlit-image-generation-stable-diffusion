# Image Generation App using Streamlit and Stable Diffusion

This project demonstrates how to create an image generation app using Streamlit and the Stable Diffusion model to generate images based on text prompts.

## Features
- Generate images from text prompts using Stable Diffusion.
- Run the app on Google Colab with GPU support.
- Public URL access using `localtunnel`.

## Tech Stack
- Streamlit
- PyTorch
- Stable Diffusion (via Hugging Face's Diffusers library)
- pyngrok/localtunnel for public URL access

> Ensure GPU is enabled on Google Colab for optimal performance.
